# SripranavM_PythonMusicPlaylist
Developed using python,tkinter,pygame 

We can add music files by clicking the add button .They appear in the box after adding .Then , we can play them by clicking on them 
and then clicking on the play button.We can rewind the song.We can also go to next song and go to previous song.The UI is very basic.We 
can also mute , unmute the music.We can also decrease and increase the volume.
The UI can be made more interactive but my main motive is to check its functionality.
